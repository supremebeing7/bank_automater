The goal of this app is to allow If This Then That type transactions for bank accounts. 

When a deposit is received from a particular source, for example a paycheck from an employer, triggers should be able to be setup that will initiate some portion of that income to be transferred to another account. 

The primary use case is allow automated savings between different bank accounts.
